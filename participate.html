                <p class="white-text">It is important that one understands the complexity of a process, be it a parent, donor or a career aspiring teacher. There are many schools for the deaf in the country following various methodologies. At Ephphatha, our Aural - Oral method encourages children to rely on words more than signs to communicate with others. This is a process, specially developed, difficult to impart, needs patience and effort on the part of teachers and students for effective implementation.</p>
