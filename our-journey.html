              <p>Founded in 1983 as a faith-based social enterprise for the hearing and speech Impaired, Ephphatha’s 30 year walk along with the disabled children has enabled us to also learn, understand and find technologies, and methods to improve the lives of affected children.</p>
              <p>Our unwavering commitment to impact the lives of children with hearing disabilities has helped us establish a well recognized and unique Institution following the Aural-Oral method of teaching in the country known as <a href="#">OSHI- Oral Higher Secondary School</a> for the Hearing Impaired.</p>

              <p>The school serves as a sanctuary of hope for many children affected with hearing disabilities – allowing us to enrich the lives of a cohort of young men and women. </p>

                      <p>These programs allowed us to find answers to underlying problems and create solutions that helped better their prospects for a brighter future.</p>
                      <p>Since our inception, we have charted countless success stories and made an impact with several of our students going on to colleges and leading a successful work life – becoming a part of society.</p>

                <p>Moved by the divine inspiration to establish a school for the hearing impaired, Dr P. J. Christopher, obeyed the calling and took a giant leap of faith to start a school, while he was going through a phase of personal distress.</p>
                <p>Dr P. J. Christopher had the opportunity of training & mentorship under subject matter experts and pioneers of deaf education in India and abroad. His extensive teaching and administrative experience in the field coupled with compassionate association with deaf people had given him a deeper understanding of the grassroots need of the hearing-impaired population and gaps found in the system of education for the deaf in India.</p>
                <p>With limited resources, Christopher could not afford a building for the school; hence, The “Oral School for the Hearing Impaired” was born at the residence of Dr Christopher on 4th February 1983! <br><br></p>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>Mr Jules Oosterwegal, a globe trotter from the Netherlands, got acquainted with Dr Christopher. A chat over a cup of coffee in a local tea shop raised the curiosity of Mr Oosterwegal to observe and familiarize with the service of Dr Christopher. Jules Oosterwegal was greatly impressed, seeing the teaching practices of the Oral School and innovative learning experiences deaf children receive. However, he was not content that such extraordinary service for the deserving children with special needs is being constrained without adequate space and a conducive physical environment.</p>
                <p>Jules returned to the Netherlands after his trip, but his thoughts were in Nagercoil where he witnessed the miracle of disabled children overcoming their barriers. This burdened him to spread the word among his friends and connected Dr Christopher with Rabo Bank, Netherlands and Teree Des Hommes, Netherlands, who later reviewed the work of Oral School, Nagercoil and gifted the present facility in 1994.</p>
