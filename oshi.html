                      <p>At OSHI we adopt the Aural - Oral methodology by which a child is taught to rely on words more than signs to communicate with others. This is a process that is specially developed, difficult to impart, yet seamlessly communicated to students. Our dedicated staff works shoulder-to shoulder with students, ensuring they grasp every topic they learn intuitively, helping them push forward in their academics - taking bold strides towards progress.</p>
