It is a journey of human excellence, as the Children will be helped not only by one's concern and support but also by enlarging their scope to interact with normal people.</p>
                <p class="white-text">Visiting Ephphatha is not a social trip for a monetary contribution. It is a pilgrimage to help segregated children from the society and periodic visits will go in a long way to help the children and build their confidence. The most important benefit is that they will know that they can interact with all people</p>
